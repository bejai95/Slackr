1. The main way that my website stands out is its user interface and user experience. It's very miimalistic which makes it intuitive to use (similar to Google). I'm taking COMP4511 this term (and took COMP4511 last term) and in that course we learn a lot about prototyping and usability testing. I decided to apply this knowledge to this assignment. Rather than just going straight into the coding, I first drew up a low-fidelity prototype (on pen and paper) and then conducted usability testing on friends and family. I then moved onto a Figma prototype and then went on to another round of usability testing. The result of this process was that I discovered the potential usability flaws early on, which enabled me to create an application which is simple, intitive, and well designed. 

2. Messages automatically send when the enter key is pressed. Also when a channel is loaded, the message box is auto-focussed, enabling the user to send messages quickly and easily, contributing to the user experience of my site. 

3. When the user sends a message, it automatically scrolls down the the most recent message sent so that the user can see what they sent and what other people reply/react. This way they don't have to scroll down to it. This mimicks other messenging platforms such as Facebook Messenger and increases usability. 

4. Stores token in local storage so the user does not need to re-sign in if they have already signed in recently on this device.

5. Count the number of each individual type of react (not just the overall number). Not sure if this was required or not?
